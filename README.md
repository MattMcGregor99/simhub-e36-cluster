# simhub-e36-cluster
My attempt at making an E36 instrument cluster that works with SimHub. Inspired by [amstudio's E36-Cluster](https://github.com/AM-STUDIO/E36-Cluster-SIMHUB) and built on top of the [SimHub E36 cluster by SHWotever](https://github.com/SHWotever/SimHub/wiki/BMW-E36-Cluster-Setup)

# Differences
Both amstudio's and SHWotever's allow for all the gauges to work such as Speed, RPM, Water Temp, Fuel Percent and Fuel Consumption. However they dont do anything with warning/indicator lamps. This inspired me to start this project.

# What works and doesnt
## Currently the following works
Gauges
* Speed (from SHWotever)
* RPM (from SHWotever)
* Water Temp (revised work from SHWotever)
Lamps
* Handbrake (!)
* Seatbelt
* Brake pad
* ....

## kinda
* Fuel

## Doesnt
* Fuel Consumption
* ABS lamp
